    <h3>Land</h3>
    <p>Costa Rica is a mountainous country located between the Caribbean Sea and Pacific Ocean. The coastal areas are
        made up of beaches and mangroves. As you move further inland, it becomes mountainous as the Talamanca Mountain
        Range divides the country. These mountains average a few thousand feet in elevation, though some peaks are much
        higher. The higher altitude mountains often ascend into the clouds, creating cloud forest habitat. The tallest
        peak in Costa Rica is Cerro Chirripo, which is 12,000 feet high. Costa Rica is also home to many volcanoes, but
        only five are considered active. There are many streams, rivers and waterfalls, but only a couple lakes. Lake
        Arenal is the largest in the country and located in front of the iconic volcano.</p>

    <h3>Plant and animal Life </h3>
    <p>The wildlife of Costa Rica comprises all naturally occurring animals, fungi and plants that reside in this Central American country. Costa Rica supports an enormous variety of wildlife, due in large part to its geographic position between North and South America, its neotropical climate, and its wide variety of habitats. Costa Rica is home to more than 500,000 species, which represent nearly 5% of the species estimated worldwide, making Costa Rica one of the 20 countries with the highest biodiversity in the world. Of these 500,000 species, a little more than 300,000 are insects.[1]

        One of the principal sources of Costa Rica's biodiversity is that the country, together with the land now considered Panama, formed a bridge connecting the North and South American continents approximately three to five million years ago. This bridge allowed the very different flora and fauna of the two continents to mix.[2]</p>
